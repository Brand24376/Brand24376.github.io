        <h1>Brandon Camacho's<br>Portfolio</h1>

        <h2>I love to code and create video games.</h2>

        <h3>Bio</h3>
        <p>
            My name is Brandon Camacho and I am currently working to become a Computer Programmer. I have learned
            various
            coding skills throughout my years of education and I am still excited to learn more about coding. I have
            worked on many coding based projects and have gotten certifications related to programming. I want my future
            job to be a video game programmer and I have done projects related to game design and programming using the
            Unity Game Engine. I am an opportunistic so when there is an opportunity to learn I will usually take it. I
            like to spend my free time by playing video games and watching YouTube videos. I am excited to see and take
            part of the future of computer programming.
        </p>

        <h3>Mission</h3>
        <p>
            As a computer programmer, my mission is to create programs and games that are interactive and fun for the
            user. I am
            passionate about computer programming and am committed to bettering myself as a computer programmer. I
            aspire to eventually be a video game developer. I believe in resilience and aim to make a difference in
            computer programming.
        </p>

            <li>JavaScript</li>

        <h3>Experience</h3>
        <p>
            I have some experience working with a team to get a project done. I was a Senior Developer for a project
            called CodeFactory which is a game we were making in Unity that was about being able to code your own
            robots to help you survive in a Minecraft like world. The code on my portfolio is for CodeFactory and they
            are some of the systems I used to get things working in the game. The first image of code is for a shop
            system that I made and it uses the code made in the second picture to dynamically load items into the shop
            system. The second image of code is used for getting the item cost and item sprite and sending it over to
            the main code for the shop system. The third image of code is a function that randomly spawns in a prefab
            between certain coordinates set. And the fourth and final image of code is the system that allows ore in
            the game to be mined and have animation when the ore is mined. I am now a Senior Developer for a project
            called PokePucks which is a game based off of Pokemon that uses these things called Pogs for the gameplay.
            I am currently working on a multiplayer backend for the game which involves making multiple chatrooms using
            WebSockets.

            I have gotten the CompTia ITF+ Certification and the OSHA 10-Hour General Industry Course certificate of
            completion. I am curently working on getting CIW JavaScript Specialist Certified. I have gotten
            distinguished honor roll at York County School of Technology so far for every marking period with the
            exception of one honor roll during one marking period, and no honor roll in another marking period. I also
            made it to the playoffs in the PlayVS regional Mario Kart 8 Deluxe E-Sports.
        </p>

        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>
            I am currently a Senior at York County School of Technology studying computer programming. I have a 3.9 GPA
            and
            am currently taking two advanced classes being AP Calculus and IB Psychology. I got both the CompTia ITF+
            Certification
            and the OSHA 10-Hour General Industry Course certificate of completion at this school. I also got many
            distinguished
            honor rolls at this school as I stated in the acomplishments section of my portfolio. I am currently in an
            E-Sports team
